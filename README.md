# md5hashtool
This is a simple script written in python to calculate the md5 hash of a file, in order to use it simply download the zip and extract the folder wherever you like. Once inside the folder edit the code and replace the "test.docx" with the filename of the file you want to verify and make sure that file is in the same folder. Once your done just run it and you will get the md5 sum.
